                <h3>First stop: Tokyo</h3><!-- #1 writing about Tokyo -->
                <p>The first city of our 6-city adventure was Tokyo, Japan. 
                <br> The moment I stepped off of the plane in Tokyo was the very moment that the adventure truly began. The first 5 hours of our trip included me getting lost in the airport, me not being able to find my luggage, me not being able to locate the friend I was meeting up with because we were opposite ends of the airport, getting lost on the subway system, us taking an Uber to the wrong hotel and later learning that the correct hotel was over 40 minutes away, then us finally making it to the correct hotel understandably exhausted. </p>

                <h3>Kyoto - it felt like home.</h3><!-- #2 writing about Kyoto -->
                <p>Probably my favorite city that we visited was Kyoto, Japan. <br> Kyoto is a city that's surrounded by mountains and has the perfect mix of modern and traditional Japanese culture. It was very different than Tokyo because it was a lot smaller city but there was still plenty to do and see there. There we stayed in a really cool hostel called <a href="https://the-millennials-kyoto-jp.book.direct/en-us/photos" target="blank">The Millennials.</a> He had the opportunity to take a tour of the Geisha District in Kyoto which was very interesting.
