                <h3>First stop: Tokyo</h3><!-- #1 writing about Tokyo -->
                <p>The first city of our 6-city adventure was Tokyo, Japan. 
                <br> The first city of our 6-city tour was Tokyo, Japan. The moment I stepped off of the plane in Tokyo was the very moment that our adventure truly began. The first 5 hours of our trip included me getting lost in the airport, not being able to find my luggage, not being able to locate the friend I was meeting up with because we were opposite ends of the airport, getting lost on the subway system, us taking an Uber to the wrong hotel and later learning that the correct hotel was over 40 minutes away, then us finally making it to the correct hotel obviously exhausted. The next day we sought to explore the city. We saw really cool shops, cafes, temples, and restaurants. We even went to one of the interactive museums called TeamLabs: Borderless with was a lot of fun. Tokyo is an incredibly crowded city but I liked it. The subways are super confusion for those who are not familiar with it's very structured and organized. The people were so kind, very warm, and respectful. Although the city had a lot of people in, it's one of the cleanest, safest cities I've ever visited. There was so much love about Tokyo. I desire to go back almost every day since returning back to the states. I hope one day I'll be able to go back and spend a significant amount of time there. It was a great first impression of Japan from a girl who knew very little about Japanese culture. </p>

                <h3>Kyoto - it felt like home.</h3><!-- #2 writing about Kyoto -->
                <p>Probably my favorite city that we visited was Kyoto, Japan. <br> Kyoto is a city that's surrounded by mountains and has the perfect mix of modern and traditional Japanese culture. It was very different than Tokyo because it was a lot smaller city but there was still plenty to do and see there. There we stayed in a really cool hostel called <a href="https://the-millennials-kyoto-jp.book.direct/en-us/photos" target="blank">The Millennials.</a> He had the opportunity to take a tour of the Geisha District in Kyoto which was very interesting.
