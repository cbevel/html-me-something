                <div><h4>In the Summer of 2019, I set out for an adventure unlike any I've ever taken before. I was on way to the other side of the globe to explore 3 of Asia's most popular countries Japan, Thailand, and Korea. This was an 18-day adventure-filled trip that included 6 different cities. This was the trip of a lifetime! </h4></div>

                <div><h3>First stop: Tokyo</h3></div>
                    <div><img src="IMG_0908.jpeg" alt="Tokyo"></div>
                        <div><p> The first city of our 6-city tour was Tokyo, Japan. The moment I stepped off of the plane in Tokyo was the very moment that our adventure truly began. The first 5 hours of our trip included me getting lost in the airport, not being able to find my luggage, not being able to locate the friend I was meeting up with because we were opposite ends of the airport, getting lost on the subway system, us taking an Uber to the wrong hotel and later learning that the correct hotel was over 40 minutes away, then us finally making it to the correct hotel obviously exhausted. The next day we sought to explore the city. We saw really cool shops, cafes, temples, and restaurants. We even went to one of the interactive museums called TeamLabs: Borderless with was a lot of fun. Tokyo is an incredibly crowded city but I liked it. The subways are super confusion for those who are not familiar with it's very structured and organized. The people were so kind, very warm, and respectful. Although the city had a lot of people in, it's one of the cleanest, safest cities I've ever visited. There was so much love about Tokyo. I desire to go back almost every day since returning back to the states. I hope one day I'll be able to go back and spend a significant amount of time there. It was a great first impression of Japan from a girl who knew very little about Japanese culture. </p></div>

                <div><h3>Kyoto - it felt like home.</h3></div>
                    <div><img src="Kyoto.jpg" alt="Kyoto"></div>
                        <div><p>After a 2 hour train ride on the Shinkansen (bullet train) through the mountains of Japan, we arrived at probably my most favorite city that we visited, Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a city that's wrapped in mountains and has the perfect blend of modern and traditional Japanese culture. It was very different than Tokyo because it was a lot smaller city but there was still plenty to do and see there. In Kyoto, we stayed in a really cool hostel called The Millennials that had very unique "pods" that we slept in that included only a bed and very modern communal spaces for visitors. We had the opportunity to take a tour of the Geisha District in Kyoto which was very interesting to learn about the traditional side of that city. We also took a 1-hour bus ride to the bamboo groves just outside of the city. While riding the bus, we were able to see parts of the Kyoto where the true residents lived. These weren't the touristy areas that you'd see on the internet but were regular neighborhoods with regular people and I felt so comfortable being there, almost like home. The feeling has yet to leave me. We got to see the mountains in Kyoto and we checked out some of the large temples and markets. To our surprise, we narrowly escaped a tragedy that happened in Kyoto on our last day. As we were heading out of the Fushimi Inari area of Kyoto, a large arson fired happened at the Animation Studio in Kyoto that killed 33 the same day in the same area that we were in shortly after we left but we were unaware that anything had happened. My mother found out about the fire and panicked thinking I was involved with it because she couldn't get a hold of me that day. My phone had died it took me a while to get it charged. She was both angry and relieved when I finally called her back to let her know that I'm alive. Despite all of that, I truly, truly enjoyed Kyoto. It is an amazingly beautiful city that everyone should that has a little something for everyone.

                <div><h3>Bangkok, not-so-hot.</h3></div>
                    <div><img src="IMG_1351.jpeg" alt="Bangkok"></div>
                         <div><p>The first stop of our Thailand excursion was in Bangkok. This portion of trip had to be one of the most frustrating cities that we had visited. It started with us flying into Bangkok from Tokyo on a twice-delayed, 6-hour turbulent flight on a budget airline. Needless to say we were very excited to have made it safely into Thailand. My first impressions of the city was that it was very lively with people, cars, and scooters. The architecture of the temples was amazing, and the people that we met were really down-to-earth. At one point, my friend and I had a 30-minute conversation with our taxi driver via Google Translate where we got to learn about his life while stuck in traffic. Unfortunately, we had to deal with constantly being on alert and aware of pick-picketers, including while in the temples, and be discerning of scammers who would tell us lies just get our money. We unfortunately did get scammed out of a decent amount of money trying to see the floating market in Bangkok on our last day but the market wasn't open at the time we wanted to go so we didn't get to see anything. The city was very dirty and reeked of sewage, and I was rats the size of small cats running around the markets. I know that Thailand is a poorer country but I wasn't expect to see what we did. On a positive note, I fell in love with a few Thai dishes that I still crave today, one being mango sticky rice. We had the chance to take a Thai cooking class during our trip and I was introduced to some really delicious meals and fruits that are native to Thailand. Overall, the city of Bangkok wasn't my favorite but what truly made up for our experience was the incredible people that we met who were helpful, warm, and welcoming. It may be a while before I decide to visit Bangkok again but I thankful for the positive things that we learned and experienced there in the city.

                <div><h3>Phuket - Beauty and Adventure</h3></div>
                    <div><img src="IMG_1409.jpeg" alt="Phuket"></div>
                        <div><p>Gorgeous - the one word I would use to describe the second Thai city of our trip, Phuket. Phuket is a city that's surrounded by mountains with beautiful beaches are the bottom of them. The countless rock formations that you can see from the ground and sky are breath-taking. We experienced an adventure like no other while we were in this city. He had a very exciting guided tour that started at 430am with a 1-hour drive to a very steep mountain we had to hike up for about 40 minutes just to see the sunrise over the rock formations in Patong. It was breathtaking! Next, our excursion took us on a 25 minute long tail boat ride to James Bond Island where got to see a few caves and got to see some of the local, also known as the monkeys. After that, we took another boat ride to a dark cave where a monkey was waiting at the entrance. To my surprise, it was a bat cave which we didn't find out until we actually in the cave. Word of advice while in a bat cave, don't talk while you're looking up. It could have devastating consequences but thankfully none of which happened to me. Also during this trip, we got do some some kayaking through the rock formations, we walked along the beach there briefly, and even took another trek thought one of the mountains to this place called the shell graveyard were we encountered some ancient tribal writings and some locals being bad in a secluded area. There were many times on that excursion where I felt like my life was in danger but overall, the tour was amazing and I got to things would have never in my life had the courage to do so I'm thankful I got to experience that. That tour was the highlight of my time in Phuket. </p></div>

                <div><h3>Chiang Mai - A pleasant surprise</h3></div>
                    <div><img src="IMG_0303.JPG" alt="Chiang Mai"></div>
                        <div><p>After spending a few days in Phuket, my friend and I took an hour long flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I really didn't know what to expect when we got there as we really didn't have any excursions planned except for an elephant sanctuary but Chiang Mai turned out to be a pleasant surprise. We stayed in the cutest Airbnb which was in walking distance to the mall that had everything we were familiar with and to a place where we could get Thai massages. The city was very clean and it'd have the smell of sewage like the other two cities had. On one of the nights were in Chiang Mai, we took a tuk-tuk to the Night Bazar which is a night market and stumbled upon another night market called Ploen Ruedee inside of the Night Bazar was so much fun. It had food and drinks, shopping, live music, dancing, lots of tourists, and henna tattoos. Surprisingly we ended up spending a few hours there. It was nice to stumble upon this night market. We were headed back to our Airbnb before we found that place. We had a really fun day with the elephants until we found out something really discouraging which put a damper on our experience there but the trip wrapped up with driving up a mountain that overlooked a city to a remote village where the weather was nice and the people we even more nice. We also got to see the golden temple at was at the top of mountain overlooking the city. It had stunning view of the entire city. Our time is Chiang Mai was a great way to wrap up our Thailand adventure. Hopefully one day I'll be able to go back to that city and be wowed by it again.

                <div><h3>Seoul - The definition of resiliency </h3></div>
                    <div><img src="IMG_0376.JPG" alt="Seoul"></div>
                        <div><p>The last stop on our adventures in Asia is Seoul, Korea. The city was huge, very clean and there lots of exciting places to see. We learned very early on in our trip to Seoul that we're going to need thick skin in order to not be so frustrated there. While we encountered some people who weren't too concerned about our presence, we did however encounter some pretty rude people who were not so nice to us including 2 taxi drivers. Also, there were times where the locals were taking pictures us with and without our permission which made us feel a little bit weird. On the first full day in Seoul, we did a tour of the entire city where we learned all about Korean history. Throughout history, Korea has endured many countries that fought to destroy them, even having an incredibly brutal civil war that divided the North from the South. After all of the things that they've endured, the enemies they've faced, and the hardships that the people in South Korea have persevered over, they've always bounced back stronger than before - the definition of resiliency. This attribute seems to be ingrained in the essence of their culture and I learned that I would have to be the same way while I was there. We also got to spend a day at the DMZ learning more about North Korea and how the divide happened. Although we saw many things in Seoul, unfortunately we couldn't see it all. This mere fact is motivation enough for me to want to go back. Seoul was beautiful and bustling and I hope to be able return to see everything that I didn't see on this trip.
